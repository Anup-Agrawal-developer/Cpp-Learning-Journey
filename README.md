# C++ Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains my structured C++ learning journey inspired by Cherno’s YouTube tutorials. 
Each topic has a dedicated folder, following a structured format with `src/`, `header/`, and `CMakeLists.txt` files.

Additionally, each folder includes a `Learnings.md` file that documents key concepts and explanations related to the topic and its code.

## 🛠️ How to Build

Each topic has its own `CMakeLists.txt`, so you need to navigate to the specific folder before building.

To build a specific topic, follow these steps:
```sh
cd <section_folder>/<topic_folder>
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For example:
```sh
cd 1_Basics/class_basics
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### **Running the Executable:**

Depending on the folder, the executable file (`Main`) may be located in different places:

- **Directly inside the `build/` directory:**
  ```sh
  ./Main
  ```
- **Inside the `bin/` directory:**
  ```sh
  ./bin/Main
  ```

Check the folder structure to determine the correct path for execution.
